      <description>&lt;p&gt;UW-Madison faculty got an email update from Vice Provost and Chief Diversity Officer Patrick Sims regarding the things we can do in response to the hate and bias incidents on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the things he had mentioned yesterday at the Faculty Senate meeting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Address hate/bias incidents in your curriculum to ameliorate unacceptable occurrences in our campus community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at &amp;ldquo;bullying&amp;rdquo; language as a way to address possible hate/bias incidents in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commit to engaging in ongoing cultural competency training. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.library.wisc.edu/lcice/&#34;&gt;Learning Communities for Institutional Change &amp;amp; Excellence (LCICE)&lt;/a&gt; as an infrastructure already provides these services campus-wide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commit to experiencing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.library.wisc.edu/lcice/&#34;&gt;leadership institute&lt;/a&gt; and become a facilitator, carving out 10-15% of your time towards these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support the request for additional staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://campusclimate.wisc.edu&#34;&gt;the Campus Climate website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attached letter from the Hate &amp;amp; Bias incident team added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your school/college/department can host a bystander intervention workshop on hate and bias. This workshop will provide tools for UW-Madison community members on when and how to intervene. If you would like to host a workshop, please contact &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:Joshua.johnson@wisc.edu&#34;&gt;Joshua Moon Johnson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many incidents go unreported for a variety of reasons. We encourage students and campus community members to &lt;a href=&#34;www.students.wisc.edu/reporthate&#34;&gt;report incidents of hate and bias&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that campus can best support the victim and work to prevent future incidents. We encourage you to post &lt;a href=&#34;www.students.wisc.edu/reporthate&#34;&gt;the link to report&lt;/a&gt; on your school/college/department websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes students do not report incidents because they are unaware of the reporting process. To increase awareness of the reporting process, we encourage you to share brochures and posters with information on how and why it is important to report. These will be distributed across campus in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students who are victims of hate and bias incidents may need immediate support. Please be sure to refer/provide students with appropriate resources such as mental health/counseling services through University Health Services (UHS). The &lt;a href=&#34;http://msc.wisc.edu&#34;&gt;Multicultural Student Center&lt;/a&gt; also has drop-in hours with UHS counselors as well as support and discussions groups for students of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many students who are victims of hate and bias incidents identify with an underrepresented racial group, gender identity or sexual orientation, or religious group. We encourage you to specifically reach out to marginalized student groups to raise awareness of the bystander intervention workshop and reporting process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a reasonably positive response to &lt;a href=&#34;http://kbroman.org/blog/2016/04/04/hateful-shit-at-uw-madison/&#34;&gt;my email to my faculty colleagues&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that we all commit to cultural competency training. But the training from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.library.wisc.edu/lcice/&#34;&gt;LCICE&lt;/a&gt; mentioned above looks to be semester-long, Tuesdays 4:30-7:30pm. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll have a difficult time convincing my colleagues of that. We need something in between nothing and 45 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hateful shit at UW-Madison</title>
      <link>http://kbroman.org/blog/2016/04/04/hateful-shit-at-uw-madison/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://kbroman.org/blog/2016/04/04/hateful-shit-at-uw-madison/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a privileged white male university professor. As privileged as they come, really. My father was a professor of chemistry; my mother also has an advanced degree in chemistry. The jobs I&amp;rsquo;ve held have been more about personal fulfillment than money: dancer, dance teacher, secretary for intellectual property lawyers, research and teaching assistant, professor. People assume I know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about, even if I&amp;rsquo;m in shorts and a t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that&amp;rsquo;s just to say that, when it comes to the ongoing hateful acts that have been happening at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I&amp;rsquo;m really the last one that you should be listening to. You should instead listen to UW students, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unitedcouncilofuw.org/&#34;&gt;United Council of UW Students&lt;/a&gt;, who have submitted &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unitedcouncilofuw.org/the-student-voice/2016/2/24/blackout-uw-system-administration-press-release-1212016&#34;&gt;a list of 5 reasonable demands&lt;/a&gt;, or Vice Provost and Chief Diversity Officer &lt;a href=&#34;http://provost.wisc.edu/climate.htm&#34;&gt;Patrick Sims&lt;/a&gt;, who made an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMBQUzwnCL0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;&gt;important 8-min video&lt;/a&gt; in response to a recent hateful incident that you should now go away and watch (really, stop reading what I have to say and spend 8 minutes watching that video), or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dance.wisc.edu/dance/people/faculty/chris-walker&#34;&gt;Chris Walker&lt;/a&gt;, Asst Prof in the dance department, who spoke movingly today at the UW-Madison Faculty Senate meeting about the shit that faculty and students of color have to put up with on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lot&amp;rsquo;s of crap has been happening in Wisconsin lately. My focus has been on what Scott Walker and company have been doing to the state and to the University of Wisconsin, most recently by making huge cuts to state support to the UW System and by weakening tenure and shared governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all been an embarrassment, and depressing, but in comparison to the hateful racist shit that&amp;rsquo;s been happening on campus, and Vice Provost Sims reported that there have been &amp;gt;30 &lt;em&gt;reported&lt;/em&gt; hate or bias incidents on campus this year, tenure and funding just don&amp;rsquo;t seem that important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Walker&amp;rsquo;s speech at the Faculty Senate today really hammered this home. As a black man on campus, he&amp;rsquo;s experienced a lot of shit: worse shit then we&amp;rsquo;re seeing in the papers. And if we don&amp;rsquo;t fix this, our students can&amp;rsquo;t be successful. We &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can a biostatistics professor do? I&amp;rsquo;m open to suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for now, I&amp;rsquo;ll follow Patrick Sims&amp;rsquo;s suggestion and start with one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.unitedcouncilofuw.org/the-student-voice/2016/2/24/blackout-uw-system-administration-press-release-1212016&#34;&gt;United Council of UW Students&amp;rsquo; demands&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We demand that the University of Wisconsin System creates and enforces comprehensive racial awareness and inclusion curriculum and trainings throughout all 26 UW Institution departments, mandatory for all students, faculty, staff, campus &amp; system administration, and regents. This curriculum and training must be vetted, maintained, and overseen by a board comprised of students, staff, and faculty of color.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written an email to the faculty in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biostat.wisc.edu&#34;&gt;my department&lt;/a&gt;, asking that we, as a department, &lt;em&gt;volunteer&lt;/em&gt; to participate in such racial awareness training:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://kbroman.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/email_to_dept1.png&#34; alt=&#34;email_to_dept&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction&lt;/strong&gt;: There&amp;rsquo;s an error in my email; Chris Walker is Associate Professor, and has been for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Chris Walker&amp;rsquo;s speech at the 4 Apr 2016 Faculty Senate meeting was &lt;a href=&#34;https://mediaspace.wisc.edu/media/Professor+Chris+Walker/1_5k9npnxs&#34;&gt;recorded&lt;/a&gt;! Must listen.&lt;/p&gt;
