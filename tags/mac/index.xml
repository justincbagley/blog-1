      <title>Muted startup</title>

      <description>It annoys me when my computer (or, even more, someone else&amp;rsquo;s computer) makes a gratuitous noise upon startup.
While I know that, on my Mac, I can avoid the sound by either muting before shutdown or holding down the mute button while starting it up, I often forget. And I am especially prone to forgetting when it&amp;rsquo;s most important that the computer be quiet.
So, I was very interested to read how to disable the start up sound at lifehacker.</description>

      <description>A cute and useful menu bar application for Macs: Caffeine, available in the App store.
If you click the little coffee cup in your menu bar (so that it&amp;rsquo;s full), it will prevent your Mac from displaying its screen saver or dimming its screen. This is especially useful when you&amp;rsquo;re giving a talk.</description>

      <title>Resizing windows in Lion</title>

      <description>I upgraded my Macs to Lion; my favorite improvement is that we can now resize windows from any edge or corner.
(Previously, you could only change the size from the lower-right corner, so I often found myself resizing and moving and then resizing and moving and then&amp;hellip;. Why did it take so long for them to do it properly?)</description>
